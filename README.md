# Team Operating Model

## Introduction

Our team operating model is rooted in the principle of aligning actions with purpose, ensuring that every team member works in harmony towards common goals. It is crafted to foster a culture of collaboration, transparency, and accountability. By integrating our organizational values and goals into our team operating model, we enable effective and efficient teamwork, driving forward initiatives that resonate with our ethos of purposeful action.
