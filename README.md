# L10 meeting

An L10 meeting, also known as a Level 10 Meeting, is a concept derived from the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), which is a set of simple concepts and practical tools used by many companies to clarify, simplify, and achieve their vision. 

The L10 meeting is a structured, bi-weekly team meeting designed to keep everyone on the same page, foster team health, and maintain focus on the most important priorities. The "10" in the name refers to the goal of making the meeting so productive and essential that participants would consistently rate it a 10 on a 10-point scale.

The key components of a Level 10 Meeting are:

1. **Segue (5 minutes)**: Team members share the good news to start the meeting on a positive note.
   
2. **Scorecard Review (5 minutes)**: Review a set of 5 to 15 leading indicators that give a quick pulse on the health of the business.

3. **Rock Review (5 minutes)**: Checking the status of the big priorities for the quarter (Rocks).

4. **Customer/Employee Headlines (5 minutes)**: Sharing brief updates or news about customers and employees.

5. **To-Do List (5 minutes)**: Review the to-do list from the previous meeting to ensure accountability.

6. **Issues List - IDS (60 minutes)**: Identifying, discussing, and solving the most pressing issues.

7. **Conclude (5 minutes)**: Review the meeting’s action items and takeaways, and rating the meeting to ensure continuous improvement.

The structure is designed to maximize efficiency, address issues promptly, and maintain a rhythm that keeps everyone aligned with the company’s long-term goals and immediate priorities.
